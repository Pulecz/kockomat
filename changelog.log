# ver 0.0.2 - 2018/12/15

changed data structure from list of dicts to nested dictionary using submission.id as primary key
changed theURL to targetURL and added redditURL from submission

long comments split to multiple lines according to PEP8
print using multiple items changed to single string using str.format()

score_list is now a list of submussion.ids sorted by the score of each submission
no need to do 2 same queries to get the score list
with the new data structure selecting the submission is easy, also the duplicate data check is no longer needed
issue #1 is hence solved https://github.com/Pulecz/kockomat/issues/1
