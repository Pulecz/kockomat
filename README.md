#1st commit (pls rewrite ME)

just main.py with secrets.txt not shared in this repo

reads from documentaries subreddit(might be changed to some custom subreddit easilly?)
saves something as a dict via pickle to 'database.db' file

read_db.py file reads the data
to play with the data in the file use:
```python
ipython -i read_db.py
```

also possible to use python instead of ipython, but I would not recommend it!

# Usage

Run main.py, watch things flow
